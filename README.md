## Description
Application consists of two sides: server and client side. Server stores all information about flights such as city of departure and arrival, date and time of arrival, date and time of departure, boeing info, passengers number. 
Moreover server stores admins' info for further authentication. The password of admins stored in hash code so even if someone get access to the database, he/she could not gain anything from this information.

Server provides information not only authorized admins but also to any user. However privileges for altering the data in the database have been given only to registered admins. 

>Server read the information about the registered users from json file and then add them to the database. In case of new admins, it is possible to make changes on json file and run the server again. It will update or even delete previous users according to json.

Any user can get information about flights stored in server's database according to the departured city and the destination city or even only by providing one of them.

> Authentication is provided by unique tokens generated by the server for each user.
